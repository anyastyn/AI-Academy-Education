# Use Case – Power Automate Helper Agent

## Problem
Power Automate flows often become slow, unreliable, or hard to maintain due to missing trigger filters, inefficient loops, connector throttling, and lack of proper error handling. These issues are difficult to identify, especially for non-expert users.

## Solution
The Power Automate Helper Agent analyzes user-provided flow exports (JSON) or textual descriptions and identifies performance, reliability, and governance issues. It explains why each issue matters and recommends concrete fixes using Power Automate settings and best practices.

## Value
The agent helps users improve flow quality, reduce failures, and follow best practices without directly modifying production flows. It acts as an expert reviewer and learning assistant.
